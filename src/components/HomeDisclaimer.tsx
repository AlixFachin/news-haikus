        This website is a hobby project, which generates haikus(*) based on some
        news of the day from <a href="www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</a>. The
        model is not perfect, and the haikus might not make sense. Please
        don&apos;t take them too seriously. <br /> I am not affiliated with The
        Guardian in any way, and the haikus do not reflect my personal opinion.{" "}
        <br />
        Several features prevents the haikus from being offensive, but I
        can&apos;t guarantee that they will always be inoffensive. If you find a
        haiku offensive, please contact me and I will remove it. If you want to
        learn more about the project, you can check the{" "}

        <span className="font-bold">Note:</span>Technically the poems on this
        page are not real haikus, as they do not refer to nature and/or seasons.
        They are closer to{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SenryÅ«">senryu</a>, but I decided
        to call them haikus for simplicity.
